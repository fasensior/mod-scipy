This is literall a copy of scipy 1.12.0 so the other repository mod-constantQ works ok. There was a problem with the signal/windows/_windows.py file because the hanning window is deprecated and I had to do a hardcode fix for it to run. All the rights and thanks and so on to the scipy people they are the best :)

This is not the original Scipy and I do not pretend to trick you into thinking so. The original scipy can be obtained at https://github.com/scipy/scipy and all the merits should go to them.
